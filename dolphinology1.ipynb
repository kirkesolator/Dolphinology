    "[Here](https://hodgkin-huxley-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/Hodgkin%20Huxley.html) is a very basic python implementation of the HH model for [reference](https://hodgkin-huxley-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/Tutorial.html). The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) page is alright, but their [original paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/) fucking rocks.\n",

    "> Currently, there are several specialized software packages available for visualizing neural phenomena from different perspectives. These include NEST, which uses unicompartmental models [11], and NEURON and GENESIS, which use both uni- and multi-compartmental models, thereby providing a more realistic model [12-15]. Of these packages, NEURON is the most popular, with numerous papers published in prestigious journals in the neuroscience field [16,17]. The literature clearly shows its efficiency in developing neuronal simulations with full control of the morphological and biophysical properties. On the other hand, it is important to highlight that, by default, NEURON uses the kinetics of the potassium and sodium channels with HH properties. \n",

    "The [NEURON website](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) and [this MiT page](http://web.mit.edu/neuron_v7.4/nrntuthtml/index.html) contains a lot of documentation we should check out."

The effect of noradrenaline on these GABAergic cells in hippocampus is ~50% reduction in gap junction conductance: ![Figure 1](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/28/8/1804/F1.medium.gif)\n",

    "will shortcircuit exitatory potentials through neighboring channels with more positive reversal potentials. GABAergic channels typically have a reversal potential around the $mV_r$ because it operates with $Cl^-$ and $K^+$, while glutamatergic channels have much more positive reversal potentials (which is why they can elicit action potentials obviously). So in theory, by opening up GABA channels, any excitatory input will affect the LOCAL $mV_r$ less on account of $K^+$ and $Cl^-$ ions more readily available (the P's in the above equation which are permeability factors) to counteract the positive charges from $Na^+$ influx. An excitatory potential should therefore degrade quicker than usual meaning it will less likely reach the soma to contribute to $mV_r$.\n",

    "> This example relies on a simplified model neuron, but Koch C. et al. (1983) developed a model that incorporates the spatial extent of the dendritic tree and the relative positioning of excitatory and shunting inhibition channels. They confirmed that shunting inhibition can lead to the desired veto-effect, but found that it will only veto excitatory input if the inhibitory conductance is located between the excitatory input and the soma. It should be noted, however, that in such a model with biophysically realistic assumptions the pure quadratic nonlinearity as envisaged in the Reichardt model is difficult to implement with shunting inhibition (Grzywacz, N. M. and Koch, C., 1987).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although generally overlooked in the literature, shunting inhibition was discovered by Fatt and Katz working on crab neuromuscular junction (Fatt and Katz, 1953). In this preparation muscle fibers are innervated by inhibitory and excitatory nerves. “…the main effect of inhibitory impulses is to attenuate the ‘end plate potentials’, i.e. to diminish the local depolarization produced by motor impulses. Inhibitory impulses do not by themselves change the resting potential of the muscle fibre, unless this has previously been displaced from its normal level. But even though no potential change may be recorded, the inhibitory impulse…always produces a transient increase in membrane conductance (or ‘ion permeability’)… .”\n",

    "The basic hypothesis we'll test is that if GABAergic synapses are activated _simultaneously_ across large parts of the neuron surface, the net effect is to wipe out the postsynaptic potential history of that neuron. This is exactly what you want in order to decrease sensitivity to stimuli like single stray spikes. A very natural byproduct of that will be changes to the local field potential oscillatory regimes ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17532059)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the various interneuron species are [typically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5511827/) connected electrically through dendrites by gap junctions. Such gap junctions facilitate synchrony because ion current flow changes are instantaneously broadcast into neighboring interneurons. More synchrony in the local interneuron network will lead to GABAergic inputs to excitatory neurons arriving closer together in time, despite being spread across the excitatory neuron surface and having different input drives. GABAergic channels change the conductance of the excitatory neuron membrane (more leaky) in effect scaling down excitatory inputs and/or limiting their spatial spread function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because neuromodulators have been shown in several instances to change the conductance of gap junctions in interneurons, these are therefore prime candidates for determining network robustness to perturbations."
